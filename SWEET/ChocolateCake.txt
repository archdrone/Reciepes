2 sticks (226 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature (plus more for the pan)
2/3 cup (56 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder (plus more for the pan)
2 cups (272 grams) all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 1/4 cups (250 grams) sugar
4 large eggs, at room temperature
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 cup (240 ml.) buttermilk, well shaken
4 ounces (113 grams) bittersweet chocolate, melted and cooled




Center a rack in the oven, and preheat it to 350. 

Butter the interiors of two 9-inch round cake pans, dust with a little cocoa powder and tap out the excess.

 Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
 
Working with an electric mixer (use the paddle, if you have one), beat the butter and sugar together on medium speed for 3 minutes, until light and fluffy. 

Add the eggs one by one, and beat for a minute after each goes in; 

beat in the vanilla. 

Reduce the speed to low, and add the dry ingredients in 3 additions and the buttermilk in 2 (start and finish with the dry, and don’t worry if the buttermilk makes the batter look slightly curdled).

 Mix in the melted chocolate. Divide the batter evenly between the pans.
 
Bake for 24 to 28 minutes, until a tester poked into the center of the cakes comes out clean.

 Transfer to racks, let rest 5 minutes and then run a blunt knife around the edges of the pans.
 
 
 Unmold the cakes onto the racks, and cool to room temperature.
