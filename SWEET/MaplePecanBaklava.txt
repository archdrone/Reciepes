Ingredients
8 ounces frozen phyllo dough thawed in the fridge overnight
5-6 ounces butter melted
8 ounces pecans toasted @ 350 F for 10 mins
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1-1/3 cup maple syrup



Instructions
Preheat oven to 325 F. Grease a 8x8-inch baking dish with melted butter.

Cut the thawed phyllo dough to fit your baking pan. While not using, cover dough with a damp kitchen towel.

Pulse toasted pecans with cinnamon and cloves in the food processor to medium fine consistency.

Place first layer of phyllo into your baking pan and brush with a thin layer of melted butter. Add another phyllo layer and repeat until you have 10 layers of phyllo.

Spread 1/5 of the nut mixture over top. Add another phyllo sheet, brush with butter and layer more phyllo until you have stacked 5 sheets. Repeat 4 times.

On the top layer stack again 10 sheets of phyllo. Your phyllo layers should look like this 10, 5, 5, 5, 5, 10 with 1/5 of the nut mixture in between each layer.

Cut the baklava into 4 strips. Then cut diagonally to create diamond shapes.

Bake baklava for 40-50 minutes. The top layer should be golden brown. Pour maple syrup (room temp or cold) over hot baklava. You will here the crackling sound of the phyllo soaking of the maple syrup.

Let baklava cool. After 2 hours, take out a corner piece and drain off any excess syrup.

You can decorate the pieces with ground nuts or even some melted chocolate.
