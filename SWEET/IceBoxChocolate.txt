Ingredients
Crust

1 1/4 cups (177g) finely crushed graham cracker crumbs
1/4 cup (50g) sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, optional; for enhanced flavor
5 tablespoons (71g) unsalted butter, melted
Filling

1/3 cup (74g) hot water
2 tablespoons (11g) Triple Cocoa Blend or Double-Dutch Dark Cocoa
1 tablespoon (14g) vanilla extract
1 1/3 cups (227g) bittersweet chocolate chips, chunks, or disks
1 1/2 cups (340g) heavy cream
1 tablespoon (14g) granulated sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
Topping

1 cup (227g) heavy cream
2 tablespoons (14g) confectioners' sugar




Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease a 9" pie pan.

To make the crust: Combine the ingredients, and press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the pan. Freeze the crust for 15 minutes (this will prevent over-browning), then bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until it's lightly browned around the edges. Remove from the oven and cool completely.

To make the filling: Combine the hot water, cocoa, and vanilla in a small measuring cup and set aside.

Heat the chocolate in a saucepan set over low heat on the stove, or in the microwave in 20-second bursts. Stir the chocolate until completely melted, and let cool for several minutes.

Whip the cream, sugar, and salt with a hand or stand mixer until soft peaks form.

Stir the cocoa mixture into the melted chocolate.

Using a whisk, fold the chocolate mixture into the whipped cream until no white streaks remain.

Spread the filling evenly into the cooled crust.

Refrigerate the pie for at least 1 hour before serving, or until the filling is firm.

For the topping, whip the cream and sugar together until the mixture is as firm (or soft) as you like.

Slice the pie, and top each serving with a dollop of whipped cream and a chocolate curl, if desired.



Notes:

Nathan wasn't a fan. It was a basically a chocolote moose. Don't think it was chocolate enough him
