1 15oz can (about 2 cups; 450g) pumpkin puree*
3 large eggs
1 and 1/4 cups (250g) packed light or dark brown sugar
1 Tablespoon (8g) cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 and 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger*
1/4 teaspoon ground or freshly grated nutmeg*
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves*
1/8 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
1 cup (240ml) heavy cream
1/4 cup (60ml) milk (I use 1% – any is fine)
egg wash: 1 large egg beaten with 1 Tablespoon milk


For the pumpkin pie filling: 
	Whisk the pumpkin, 3 eggs, and brown sugar together until combined.
        Add the cornstarch, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, pepper, cream, and milk.
        Vigorously whisk until everything is combined.

Crust:
	Crimp the edges with a fork or flute the edges with your fingers, if desired.
        Brush edges lightly with egg wash mixture.
        Line the pie crust with parchment paper.
        Crunching up the parchment paper is helpful so that you can easily shape it into the crust.
        Fill with pie weights or dried beans. (Note that you will need at least 2 standard sets of pie weights to fit.) 
        Make sure the weights/beans are evenly distributed around the pie dish.
        Par-bake the crust for 10 minutes.
        Carefully remove the parchment paper/pie weights.


Bake:
	Pour pumpkin pie filling into the warm pre-baked crust.
        Only fill the crust about 3/4 of the way up.
  	Bake the pie until the center is almost set, about 55-60 minutes give or take. A small part of the center will be wobbly – that’s ok. 
        After 25 minutes of baking, be sure to cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil or use a pie crust shield to prevent the edges from getting too brown.
        Check for doneness at minute 50, and then 55, and then 60, etc.
        Once done, transfer the pie to a wire rack and allow to cool completely for at least 3 hours.
