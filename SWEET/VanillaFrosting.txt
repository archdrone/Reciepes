VANIILA BUTTERCREAM FROSTING

From: https://belleofthekitchen.com/the-best-vanilla-buttercream-frosting/


1 cup unsalted butter (2 sticks), softened
4.5 cups powdered sugar
1 Tablespoon pure vanilla extract
4-5 Tablespoons heavy cream or whole milk



Beat the softened butter over medium speed with an electric mixer until soft and creamy.

Continue to beat over medium speed as you gradually add the powdered sugar.

Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula as needed to fully incorporate all of the sugar.

Once butter and sugar have come together, add the vanilla.

Beat in the heavy cream or milk 1 Tablespoon at a time until desired consistency is reached.
