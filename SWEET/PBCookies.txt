Peanut Butter Cookies
From: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/11024/joeys-peanut-butter-cookies/

Ingredient Checklist
1 cup peanut butter
½ cup butter, softened
½ cup white sugar
½ cup packed brown sugar
1 egg
3 tablespoons milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
¾ teaspoon baking powder
¼ teaspoon salt




Step 1
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Step 2
In a large bowl, cream together the peanut butter, butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until well blended. Beat in the egg, milk, and vanilla one at a time. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into creamed mixture. Roll tablespoonfuls of dough into balls. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets. Press each ball once with fork tines.

Step 3
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are lightly browned.




Notes:
First attempt is a little drier then I'd like. I ended up using cream instead of milk but I think it needs more yolks. Should compare with other recipes.
